# Sales Prediction using Python

## Introduction
This project involves predicting sales by analyzing the relationship between advertising expenditures on various platforms like TV, radio, and newspaper. Leveraging Python and machine learning techniques, particularly linear regression, this project aims to provide insights into how different advertising channels impact sales figures.


## Objective
To forecast sales by considering factors such as advertising expenditure on different platforms.

## Getting Started
To begin with, make sure you have Python installed along with necessary libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter notebook `Sales_Prediction.ipynb`.
2. Execute the cells to see the code in action and visualize the results.

## Description
- The notebook begins with importing essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
- Data is loaded from the `sales.csv` file and explored to understand its structure and distribution.
- Descriptive statistics and visualizations are used to analyze the relationship between advertising expenses and sales.
- A correlation heatmap is plotted to identify the strength of relationships between variables.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a linear regression model is trained on the TV advertising budget to predict sales.
- Model evaluation is performed, and predictions are visualized against actual sales figures.

## Observations
- TV advertising expenditure shows a strong positive correlation with sales, indicating its effectiveness in driving sales.
- Radio advertising also correlates positively with sales but to a lesser extent compared to TV.
- Newspaper advertising shows a weaker correlation with sales compared to TV and radio.
- Linear regression modeling demonstrates the predictive power of advertising expenditures on sales.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the relationship between advertising spending and resulting sales. By leveraging machine learning techniques, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies to maximize sales potential and drive growth.
